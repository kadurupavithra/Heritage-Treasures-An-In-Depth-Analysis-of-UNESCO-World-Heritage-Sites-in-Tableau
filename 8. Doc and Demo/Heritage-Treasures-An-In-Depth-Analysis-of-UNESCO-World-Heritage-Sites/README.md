# 🌍 UNESCO Heritage Treasures Web Application

## 📊 Abstract
Cultural heritage sites represent the history and identity of nations across the globe. This project, **UNESCO Heritage Treasures Web Application**, is a Flask-based system integrated with Tableau Public to analyze UNESCO World Heritage Sites (2019 dataset). The application provides user authentication and an interactive dashboard to visualize country-wise distribution, endangered sites, and regional inscription trends. This project demonstrates data analytics and full-stack web development using Python, Flask, and Tableau.

## 📖 Introduction
UNESCO World Heritage Sites are recognized for their cultural, natural, or mixed significance. Raw datasets can be complex and difficult to interpret. This application transforms UNESCO data into interactive visual dashboards that help users explore meaningful insights easily.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design an interactive UNESCO heritage analysis dashboard  
- Implement user login and registration functionality  
- Visualize global heritage site distribution  
- Analyze endangered sites and risk percentage  
- Study regional inscription trends  
- Integrate Tableau dashboard into a Flask web application  

---

## 📌 Scope of the Project
This project is suitable for academic submissions and data analytics demonstrations. It focuses on visualization and analysis of UNESCO data and does not perform predictive modeling in the current version.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The application follows a client–server architecture:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS  
- Backend: Python Flask  
- Visualization: Tableau Public  
- Data Source: UNESCO CSV Dataset (2019)  

Flask routes handle user requests, and the Tableau dashboard is embedded into the web interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Flask  
- Tableau Public  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- CSV Dataset
